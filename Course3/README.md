Wellcome to our GitHub repo for the course. You can clone the repository and solve the assignments locally, or run them on Google Colab.

## Running on Google Colab
Google has released its own flavour of Jupyter called Colab, which has free GPUs!

Here's how you can use it:
1. Open https://colab.research.google.com, click **Sign in** in the upper right corner, use your Google credentials to sign in.
2. Click **GITHUB** tab, paste https://github.com/hse-aml/bayesian-methods-for-ml and press Enter
3. Choose the notebook you want to open, e.g. `week2/em_assignment.ipynb`
4. Click **File -> Save a copy in Drive...** to save your progress in Google Drive
5. To use GPU click **Runtime -> Change runtime type** and select **GPU** in Hardware accelerator box
6. If you run many notebooks on Colab, they can continue to eat up memory, you can check GPU memory usage with `! nvidia-smi`.
